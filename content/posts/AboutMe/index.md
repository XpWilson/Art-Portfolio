Hello, my name is Wilson De Jesus Castillo and I adore creating games.

I am a technical artist with knowledge of using shader-graph for the Unity Engine. I was in charge of establishing the visual aesthetic for [Fate’s Twisted Tower (PC)](https://fatestwisted.itch.io/fates-twisted-tower) & [Fate’s Twisted Mountain (PC)](https://xpoverdrive.itch.io/fates-twisted-mountain). My goal is to continue learning the various pipelines and branches of VFX under the context of game creation.

If you want to contact me my email is: wcastillo@proton.me.

My resume is linked below.
