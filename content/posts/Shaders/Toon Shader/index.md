The models used in this demo were created by [Hitbear Studio](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/action-rpg-starter-kit-9076).
## Summary
This shader demonstrates a shader I created to give characters a cartoony, or cel-shaded aesthetic. This shader was used in both games I helped create Fate’s Twisted Tower and Fate’s Twisted Mountain. This shader was created using Shadergraph for Unity as with all shader utilities these principles can be transferred to most programs.

## Features
1. Adjustable shadow length & softening lighting

2. Adjustable Outline sizes

## Comparison
Here is a comparison between character models using the standard-lit material versus the Toon shader material.

This shader while mostly designed for characters can also be used for objects so it can give one’s whole environment the cartoony aesthethic.
